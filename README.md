# A Chip-8 Emulator For Fun

Implemented in (lousy) C++. http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/ for inspiration.

This is not a very good code sample...just something janky I hacked together over an afternoon or two. It does, however, work. 
After playing about an hour of Tetris in black and white, I moved on to emulating the [6502](https://github.com/oleiman/6502-emu).
The result is still a work in progress, but the code is better.
